# PROJECT SETUP SOP

## 1. Create Users

Project owner, developers, client, etc.

## 2. Create Groups

Helps organize users. Make sure to update product access, so added groups can access Jira.

## 3. Create Project Roles

Not always 1-to-1 to users and groups. Can specify default members and groups.

## 4. Create Permission Scheme

Specific to project. Under **Issues** section. Assign project permissions to respective roles.

May be faster to create from scratch than copying existing and modifying.

## 5. Create Project

Update project to use permission scheme.

## 6. Assign Users and Groups to Roles

## 7. Test
